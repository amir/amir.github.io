title: Untyped Arithmetic Expressions
tags: [tapl]
---
Chapters 3 and 4 of the book develop the required tools for a small and trivial language of numbers and booleans.  You can find the [OCaml implementation](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/checkers/arith.tar.gz) of this language on book's website.  And you can find my Rust implementation at [arith.rs](https://github.com/amir/tapl.rs/blob/master/src/tapl/arith.rs).
